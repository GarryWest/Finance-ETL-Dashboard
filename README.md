# 📊 Finance ETL + Dashboard

## Project Overview
This repository contains an **ETL pipeline and interactive dashboard** designed to process and visualize financial time‑series data. The goal is to demonstrate applied skills in **Python, SQL, and Power BI** by building a reproducible workflow that ingests raw market data, transforms it into structured tables, and surfaces insights through dynamic visualizations.

## Objectives
- ✅ Build a Python/SQL ETL pipeline to ingest and clean financial datasets.  
- ✅ Normalize schema and date formats for consistency across sources.  
- ✅ Load transformed data into SQL Server for structured analysis.  
- ✅ Create Power BI dashboards to visualize market trends, sector performance, and time‑series comparisons.  
- ✅ Document workflow steps for reproducibility and recruiter visibility.  

## Current Status
🚧 **In Progress (Week 1 – Setup)**  
- Repository created and initialized.  
- Draft README established with project goals.  
- Initial datasets identified and downloaded.  

## Data Sources
- **Yahoo Finance** — stock price and market index data.  
- **FRED (Federal Reserve Economic Data)** — macroeconomic indicators and time‑series datasets.  

## Tech Stack
- **Python** — ETL scripting, data cleaning, transformation.  
- **SQL Server** — structured storage and query optimization.  
- **Power BI** — interactive dashboards and visualizations.  
- **GitHub** — version control and project documentation.  

## Roadmap
- **Week 2 (Dec 8–14):** Build ETL skeleton scripts for ingestion and normalization.  
- **Week 3 (Dec 15–21):** Draft Power BI dashboards with placeholder visuals.  
- **Week 4 (Dec 22–31):** Publish repo publicly, share initial progress on LinkedIn.
